## Introduction

A nano currency wallet that consists of one main account and a pool of accounts. Pool accounts are used for transactions going in/out of the main account. A pool address is reserved for each specific transaction, either for a send of any amount, for a receive of any amount, or for a receive of a specific amount. Any unexpected balances found in pool accounts are automatically refunded to the sender.

The main purpose of this pool wallet is for identifying incoming transactions. By reserving a unique address for each one for the duration of the transaction the wallet owner will be able to tell which transaction is paid for (for example in the case where you are expecting two payments for two sales of the same amount). It adds some degree of obfuscation as a side effect but that is not the intended purpose.

By using a pool wallet like this you can also distribute several accounts and have them automatically connected to a main account ("hot wallet"), by routing any incoming/outgoing transactions to/from the main account. The pool accounts are generated by incrementing the account index (the main account uses index 0), so they can be pre-generated and distributed.

## Sending

The balance is sent from the main account to a free pool account. If no free pool account exists a new one will be generated. Then the balance is sent from the pool account to the destination address. Finally the pool account is freed to be used for other transactions.

## Receiving any amount

A free pool account is reserved, if no free account exists a new one will be generated. The reserved pool account address should be shared with the sender. As soon as any amount is received it is sent to the main account and the pool account will be freed. If no amount is received within a given time a timeout will occur and the pool account is freed. Any transaction received after that will be refunded as usual.

## Receiving a specific amount

A free pool account is reserved, if no free account exists a new one will be generated. The reserved pool account address should be shared with the sender. As soon as the specified amount is received it is sent to the main account and the pool account will be freed. Any amounts receives besides the specified amount are refunded. If the amount is not received within a given time a timeout will occur and the pool account is freed. Any transaction received after that will be refunded as usual.

## Refunding unexpected transactions

All pool accounts have their incoming balances monitored. If an unexpected balance is received it is immediately returned to the sender.

## Quick Setup

1. run nano node (set up work peer and enable rpc control)

```bash
sudo docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d \
  -p 17075:17075 \
  -p 17075:17075/udp \
  -p 127.0.0.1:17076:17076 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:17078:17078 \
  -v ~/nano/test:/root \
  --name nano-test \
  nanocurrency/nano-test
```

2. run nano work server

```powershell
.\nano-work-server.exe --gpu 0:0 --listen-address <WSL ethernet adapter ip>:1000
```

3. set node.work_peers setting in config-node.toml to 

```toml
["::ffff:<WSL ethernet adapter ip>:1000"]
```

If using Docker Desktop and WSL2 make sure that the docker subnet contains the WSL ethernet adapter ip
```json
# in daemon.json add

“default-address-pools” : [
{
“base” : “172.31.0.0/16”,
“size” : 24
}
```

4. set up config/Config.toml

5. run program

```bash
cargo run
```

## Run tests

```bash
cargo test
```
